</div>

#### Key Features:

-Massively Parallel Processing (MPP): Distributes data and query load across multiple nodes, speeding up complex queries.
- Columnar Storage: Optimizes storage and retrieval for analytical queries.
- Compression: Reduces storage costs and improves performance by compressing data.
- Redshift Spectrum: Enables querying of data stored in Amazon S3 without having to load it into Redshift.

#### Use in Project:
`Amazon Redshift` is used as the primary data warehousing solution, storing large volumes of structured data from various sources. It provides fast query performance, allowing MadHatter Corp. to perform complex analytics and reporting efficiently.

### Amazon Athena

`Amazon Athena` is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data directly in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to manage, and you pay only for the queries you run.

</div>

#### Key Features:

- Serverless Architecture: Eliminates the need to set up or manage servers.
- Standard SQL Support: Allows you to use familiar SQL syntax to query data.
- Integration with S3: Directly queries data stored in Amazon S3, supporting a wide range of formats including CSV, JSON, ORC, Avro, and Parquet.
- Cost-Effective: Charges based on the amount of data scanned by the queries.

#### Use in Project:
`Amazon Athena` is used for ad-hoc querying and analysis of data stored in Amazon S3. It allows MadHatter Corp. to quickly run queries on large datasets without needing to load the data into a database, providing flexibility and cost savings for exploratory analysis.

### AWS Lambda

`AWS Lambda` is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources. It allows you to build applications that respond quickly to new information.

    <img src="assets/Lambda.png" alt="AWS Lambda" width="200" height="200">
</div>

#### Key Features:

- Event-Driven Execution: Runs code in response to triggers such as changes to data, HTTP requests, or system events.
- Automatic Scaling: Automatically scales based on the number of incoming events.
- Pay-As-You-Go: Charges only for the compute time you consume, making it cost-effective.
- Wide Language Support: Supports multiple programming languages including Python, Node.js, Java, C#, and Go.

#### Use in Project:
`AWS Lambda` is used to process data in real-time as it streams through Amazon Kinesis. It performs tasks such as data transformation, enrichment, and forwarding to other services like Amazon Redshift and Amazon Elasticsearch Service, ensuring immediate processing and action on incoming data.

### Amazon Kinesis

`Amazon Kinesis` is a platform for real-time data streaming on AWS, making it easy to collect, process, and analyze real-time, streaming data. It is ideal for applications that require continuous, real-time data processing.

    <img src="assets/Kinesis.png" alt="Amazon Kinesis" width="200" height="200">
</div>

#### Key Features:

- Real-Time Data Capture: Captures streaming data from various sources and processes it in real-time.
- Scalability: Scales to handle gigabytes of data per second from hundreds of thousands of sources.
- Multiple Services: Includes Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Data Firehose, Kinesis Data Analytics, and Kinesis Video Streams for different use cases.
- Integration with AWS Services: Integrates seamlessly with AWS services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, and more.

#### Use in Project:
`Amazon Kinesis` is used to capture and stream real-time data from various sources within MadHatter Corp. This includes user interactions, transaction logs, and IoT devices. Kinesis ensures that data is ingested as it arrives, enabling immediate processing and analysis.
